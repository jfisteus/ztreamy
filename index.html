            It fixes a bug with zlib compression when content
            was served from the recent events buffer
            through the last-seen feature.

            The major novelties are a fully refactored event dispatching
            module and a web dashboard to follow the stream
            from a web browser (just append <code>/dashboard.html</code>
            to the main stream URL and load that from a browser,
            e.g.: http://localhost:9000/events/dashboard.html).

            (<a href="download/">download</a>).
            The installation procedure is now easier,
            since it can be automatically downloaded and installed
            from the PyPI software repository.
            See in the
            <a href="doc/quick-start-guide.html">Quick Start Guide</a>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
           Ztreamy is a prototype implementation of a framework for
           publishing streams of semantically-annotated data
           (e.g. readings from sensores) through on the Web, built on
           top of the <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado Web
           server</a>. The framework provides services that are
           specific to events described with RDF, although any other
           kinds of events can be transported as well.  The platform
           provides scalability through replication: streams can be
           repeated from other servers. Streams can also be aggregated
           and filtered.

	  Semantics. Its <a href="http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/papers/2013/ztreamy/">preprint
	  is publicly available for download</a>. If you want to cite
